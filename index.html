        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>I enjoy working in quiet and reserved enviroments,
            where I'm not easily distracted or disturbed.
            Like any other human on the face of the earth today,
            I'm into music, TV shows, movies and books. My biggest
            character deviation is, every now and then, to put myself in
            situations like swimming, cycling and running in sequence,
            in order to win a normal finisher medal and a banana at the end:
            I'm an amateur triathlete.</p>
